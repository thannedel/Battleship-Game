# Quick Start

### JDK
You 'll need a current version of a JDK. If you don't already have one, go to Oracle or Amazon Coretto and follow the instructions acording to your OS. 

### Install Gradle

**For Mac Users:**

If you have previously installed Homebrew, you can use that to install the latest Gradle package.
```
brew install gradle
```
If you have not installed Homebrew, then follow the advice at the Gradle site and use sdkman.  sdkman is like Homebrew, but implemented
in and for Java programs.

Get sdkman with
```
curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash
```
Then open a new Terminal window -- the simplest way to make sure sdk is now available â€“ and execute
```
sdk install gradle 2.14.1
```

**For Windows/Linux:**

* Download the latest binaries from Gradle's download page
* Unpack the zip to folder (e.g. "C:/Program Files").  
* Add the GRADLE_HOME/bin folder to your PATH environment variable.
* Open the system properties (WinKey + Pause), select the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button
* Then add "C:\Program Files\gradle-x.x\bin", or wherever you unzipped Gradle to, to the end of your "Path" variable under
* System Properties 


**TIP:**
Remember to replace the x.x in the example with the gradle version number you downloaded.  Be sure to omit any quotation marks around
the path even if it contains spaces. Also make sure you separated from previous PATH entries with a semicolon ";".


### Running The App

**From the Terminal:**

```
./gradlew bootRun

```

**From the IDE:**

* Open the Gradle tool window
* Select the Gradle task application | bootRun

### Databases

**Create an *application.properties* text file in your project.
Put this file in the src/main/resources directory.**  

In Development mode I strongly recommend using H2 (in memory databse)

**Application Properties for H2**

In the application.properties add this line:

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true

```

**Access to H2 Console**

* Open http://localhost:8080/h2-console

* Login and hit Connect

**Connect to MySQL**

* Create *salvo* Database in your MySql admin
* Change your application properties to:
```
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/salvo
spring.datasource.username = YOUR_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password = YOUR_PASSWORD
```

### Some Extra Configuration (recommended)

To avoid accidental name conflicts between the RestRepository controller and anything else we have, tell Spring to use /rest as a prefix for all
RestRepository URLs.

Add the following lines to application.properties:
```
spring.data.rest.base-path=/rest
spring.jackson.serialization.INDENT_OUTPUT=true
```

The first one tells Spring to
put /rest in front of all RestRepository URLs, e.g., /rest/games instead of /games

The second to send all JSON, from any source, in a nicely indented form
